## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Create `ShareShed` database.
4. Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start:dev`.
5. Navigate to `localhost:1337` to see the site in the browser.
6. Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
